	\begin{poem*}{Ozymandias}{Percy Bysshe Shelley}
		I met a traveller from an antique land, \\
		Who said, ``Two vast and trunkless legs of stone \\
		Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, \\
		Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\\
		And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\\
		Tell that its sculptor well those passions read\\
		Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\\
		The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;\\
		And on the pedestal these words appear:\\
		'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\\
		Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'\\
		Nothing beside remains. Round the decay\\
		Of that Colossal Wreck, boundless and bare,\\
		The lone and level sands stretch far away.''\\
	\end{poem*}
	
	\begin{poem*}{Invictus}{William Henley}
		Out of the night that covers me,\\
		\hspace{2em}Black as the pit from pole to pole,\\
		I thank whatever gods may be\\
		\hspace{2em}For my unconquerable soul.\\[12pt]
		In the fell clutch of circumstance\\
		\hspace{2em}I have not winced nor cried aloud.\\
		Under the bludgeonings of chance\\
		\hspace{2em}My head is bloody, but unbowed.\\[12pt]
		Beyond this place of wrath and tears\\
		\hspace{2em}Looms but the Horror of the shade,\\
		And yet the menace of the years\\
		\hspace{2em}Finds and shall find me unafraid.\\[12pt]
		It matters not how strait the gate,\\
		\hspace{2em}How charged with punishments the scroll,\\
		I am the master of my fate,\\
		\hspace{2em}I am the captain of my soul.\\
	\end{poem*}
